# Introduction

the loss and the operational cost of distribution networks is a critical
goal for distribution system operators (DSOs). Distribution networks, by
nature, are unbalanced in terms of voltages and currents because of
having untransposed lines [@paranavithana2009global] in distribution
feeders and integration of single-phase generators and loads with highly
probabilistic behavior. While voltage imbalance mostly impacts the
costumers' power quality, the current imbalance is one of the main
causes of loss increase in distribution networks. Mitigation of current
and voltage imbalance sources is a serious technical requirement and has
drawn the attention of researchers for many years. We review the
approaches revolving around the voltage and current imbalance
compensation in the following.

Based on [@kong2017three] we can decompose the origins of the imbalance
into twofold classes: structural and random. The method focusing on the
structural aspect includes network reconfiguration
[@borozan1997; @morton2000efficient; @dall2014sparsity; @ding2015feeder; @fu2018toward]
and phase balancing
[@zhu1998phase; @chen1999optimal; @siti2007reconfiguration]. These
techniques, however, do not have real-time flexibility and continuous
controllability for compensating the random component of imbalance.
Static transfer system (STS) based methods are proposed to compensate
for this [@ding2018per]. This method may impose switching transients and
is less flexible than power electronics devices with continuous
controllability. Device-based compensation has been broadly investigated
in the literature and proved outstanding capability in mitigating the
current imbalance
[@valderrama2001reactive; @pires2004unbalanced; @salmeron2004compensation; @xu2007voltage].
These techniques were rarely implemented in the past but their
integrations are abruptly on the rise due to the proliferation of
Distributed Energy Resources (PVs) and Electrical Vehicle Charge
Stations (EVCSs).

Local control strategies for leveraging distributed energy PVs for
imbalance compensation have been discussed in
[@singh2010grid; @weckx2015load]. These approaches, as expected, are
highly effective but they still lack utilization of full capability of
flexible power electronics resources due to the control with incomplete
local information status. In the wake of cyber-physical distribution
networks enabled by the vast deployment of communication systems, the
operational strategies running over the network model with complete
system-wide information turn into a real practice
[@dall2012optimization; @robbins2015optimal; @araujo2013three; @su2014optimal; @nguyen2018exact; @sheshyekani2019participation].
These methods accommodate the controllability of PV resources and seek
to minimize the operation cost in the presence of distribution network
imbalance. Voltage imbalance is tackled as a subsidiary objective
function in the optimization problem.

All of the methods mentioned in last paragraph mainly revolve around
three-phase or single-phase PVs but non of them implements the
cross-phase capability for the three-phase inverters in their models. In
addition, they are either proposing a non-convex model which compromises
the computational performance, or if they propose a convex model, it is
only valid in radial topology and due to the rectangular model
requirement for those simplifications, the highly non-linear non-convex
VUF equation is ignored. Therefore, in this paper a novel feasible
three-phase optimal power flow that can also include the above motioned
overlooked aspects is tailored which includes these main features:

-   Introducing a Convex (QP) three-phase optimal power flow that models
    bus voltages in polar form with magnitudes and angles and uses
    linearized load flow equations and capacity constraints that
    minimizes an objective function including total cost and a
    polynomial data driven approximation of VUF which is computationally
    fast and scalable because of convexity and can also be implemented
    in heavily meshed three-phase distribution networks.

```{=html}

```
-   Participating the ever-growing three- and single-phase EV chargers
    alongside with three- and single-phase PVs in optimal power flow
    operation not only to avoid their possible harmful operation but
    also exploiting the full capacity of installed devices to reduce
    cost and improve system conditions.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Introducing Cross-phase operation in three-phase inverter models
    that can exploit the unused three-phase inverter capacity in terms
    of active and reactive power in different operational and
    non-operational modes in order to improve system conditions and
    reduce the cost even more.

Various sub-methods and scenarios are created, tested, and compared in
IEEE 33 bus radial and 192 bus heavily meshed test systems. The provided
results fully compare the scenarios, sub-methods, Inverter devices, and
the two topologies in terms of cost, loss and VUF. The results Also
create a starting point to address these critical questions for DSOs; 1)
How much should an inverter or load owner pay for making system
unbalanced. and 2) How much should be paid for an inverter owner for
enabling the cross-phase operation.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section @
formulates the proposed optimization problem. The computation
implementation is described in @. Section @ shows the parameter tuning
while the results and the corresponding discussion are presented in
section @. Finally, conclusive remarks are presented in Section @.

# Problem Formulation

The optimization problem is cast based on an OPF model with a single
objective function and multiple physical and operational constraints
including the imbalance limits. The convex form of the OPF model is
employed here and the new constraints are convexified to be in line with
the whole model trait.

## Power Flow model

Three-phase power balance equations consisting of PV injection, EV
interaction, and load consumption are expressed as:

$$\label{P_ij_phigamma}
\begin{split}
\forall i\in N,\varphi\in\phi, \hskip 80pt\\
P_{i_{inject}}^{\varphi}+P_{i_{PV}}^{\varphi}=P_{i_{ld}}^{\varphi}+P_{i_{EV}}^{\varphi}+
\displaystyle\sum_{j|(i,j)\in L}\displaystyle\sum_{\gamma|\gamma\in\phi}P_{ij}^{\phi\gamma}
\end{split}$$

::: center
$$\label{Q_ij_phigamma}
\begin{split}
\forall i\in N,\varphi\in\phi, \hskip 80pt\\ Q_{i_{inject}}^{\varphi}+Q_{i_{PV}}^{\varphi}=Q_{i_{ld}}^{\varphi}+Q_{i_{EV}}^{\varphi}+
\displaystyle\sum_{j|(i,j)\in L}\displaystyle\sum_{\gamma|\gamma\in\phi}Q_{ij}^{\phi\gamma}
\end{split}$$
:::

It is implicitly assumed in the framework that if a bus does not have a
connected device (MV transformer, PV or EVCS) the corresponding active
and reactive power related to that device is forced to be zero. In
addition, the self and mutual impedance of all phases are also accounted
in the three-phase active and reactive power balance equations. In
([\[P_ij_phigamma\]](#P_ij_phigamma){reference-type="ref"
reference="P_ij_phigamma"}) and
([\[Q_ij_phigamma\]](#Q_ij_phigamma){reference-type="ref"
reference="Q_ij_phigamma"}) the $P_{ij}^{\varphi\gamma}$ and
$Q_{ij}^{\varphi\gamma}$ can be written as:

$$\label{4}
P_{ij}^{\varphi\gamma}=
\frac
{
\begin{split}
\forall (i,j) \in L, \varphi,\gamma \in \phi \hskip 50pt\\
R_{ij}^{\varphi\gamma}(V_{i}^{\varphi})^2 -R_{ij}^{\varphi\gamma}V_{i}^{\varphi}V_{j}^{\gamma} \cos(\theta_{i}^{\varphi}-\theta_{j}^{\gamma})\\+ X_{ij}^{\varphi\gamma}V_{i}^{\varphi}V_{j}^{\gamma}\sin(\theta_{i}^{\varphi}-\theta_{j}^{\gamma})
\end{split}}
{\left(R_{ij}^{\varphi\gamma}\right)^2 + \left(X_{ij}^{\varphi\gamma}\right)^2}$$

$$\label{5}
Q_{ij}^{\varphi\gamma}= \frac
{
\begin{split}
\forall (i,j) \in L, \varphi,\gamma \in \phi \hskip 50pt\\
X_{ij}^{\varphi\gamma}(V_{i}^{\varphi})^2 -R_{ij}^{\varphi\gamma}V_{i}^{\varphi}V_{j}^{\gamma} \sin(\theta_{i}^{\varphi}-\theta_{j}^{\gamma})\\ +X_{ij}^{\varphi\gamma}V_{i}^{\varphi}V_{j}^{\gamma}\cos(\theta_{i}^{\varphi}-\theta_{j}^{\gamma})
\end{split}
}
{\left(R_{ij}^{\varphi\gamma}\right)^2 + \left(X_{ij}^{\varphi\gamma}\right)^2}$$

In order to have a convex optimization model and tackle the problem via
one of the efficient convex solvers, the linearized forms of (1) and (2)
for single-phase distribution network are taken from [@yuan2016novel]
and extended to three-phase unbalanced network. Equations
([\[replaced_P_ij_phigamma\]](#replaced_P_ij_phigamma){reference-type="ref"
reference="replaced_P_ij_phigamma"}) and
([\[replaced_Q_ij_phigamma\]](#replaced_Q_ij_phigamma){reference-type="ref"
reference="replaced_Q_ij_phigamma"}) denote branch active and reactive
power losses and are defined based on the linearized power flow
expression captured in
([\[branch_active_power\]](#branch_active_power){reference-type="ref"
reference="branch_active_power"})-([\[linearized_Qij2\]](#linearized_Qij2){reference-type="ref"
reference="linearized_Qij2"}). As justifiable assumptions in
distribution networks, it is assumed that the voltage magnitudes are
around 1 p.u. and the angle differences of successive nodes are close to
zero.

$$\label{branch_active_power} \hskip 1pc
P_{ij}^{\varphi\gamma} \approx \hat{P_{ij-1}^{\varphi\gamma}} + \hat{P_{ij-2}^{\varphi\gamma}} = \hat{P}_{ij}^{\varphi\gamma}$$

$$\label{branch_reactive_power}
\hskip 1pc
Q_{ij}^{\varphi\gamma} \approx \hat{Q_{ij-1}^{\varphi\gamma}} + \hat{Q_{ij-2}^{\varphi\gamma}} = \hat{Q}_{ij}^{\varphi\gamma}$$

$$\label{linearized_Pij1}
\hat{P _{ij-1} ^{\varphi\gamma} }=\frac {r_{ij}^{\varphi\gamma}x_{ij}^{\varphi\gamma}} {r_{ij}^{\varphi\gamma2}+ x_{ij}^{\varphi\gamma2}} . \frac {V _{i} ^{\varphi} - V _{j} ^{\varphi}} {x _{ij} ^{\varphi\gamma}} = k _{ij-1} ^{\varphi\gamma} . \frac {V _{i} ^{\varphi} - V _{j} ^{\varphi}} {x _{ij} ^{\varphi\gamma}}$$

$$\label{linearized_Pij2}
\hat{P _{ij-2} ^{\varphi\gamma}}=\frac {x_{ij}^{\varphi\gamma2}} {r_{ij}^{\varphi\gamma2}+ x_{ij}^{\varphi\gamma2}} . \frac {\theta _{i} ^{\varphi} - \theta _{j} ^{\varphi}} {x _{ij} ^{\varphi\gamma}} = k _{ij-2} ^{\varphi\gamma} . \frac {\theta _{i} ^{\varphi} - \theta _{j} ^{\varphi}} {x _{ij} ^{\varphi\gamma}}$$

$$\label{linearized_Qij1}
\hat{Q _{ij-1} ^{\varphi\gamma}}=\frac {-r_{ij}^{\varphi\gamma}x_{ij}^{\varphi\gamma}} {r_{ij}^{\varphi\gamma2}+ x_{ij}^{\varphi\gamma2}} . \frac {\theta _{i} ^{\varphi} - \theta _{j} ^{\varphi}} {x _{ij} ^{\varphi\gamma}} =- k _{ij-1} ^{\varphi\gamma} . \frac {\theta _{i} ^{\varphi} - \theta _{j} ^{\varphi}} {x _{ij} ^{\varphi\gamma}}$$

$$\label{linearized_Qij2}
\hat{Q _{ij-2} ^{\varphi\gamma}}=\frac {x_{ij}^{\varphi\gamma2}} {r_{ij}^{\varphi\gamma2}+ x_{ij}^{\varphi\gamma2}} . \frac {V _{i} ^{\varphi} - V _{j} ^{\varphi}} {x _{ij} ^{\varphi\gamma}} = k _{ij-2} ^{\varphi\gamma} . \frac {V _{i} ^{\varphi} - V _{j} ^{\varphi}} {x _{ij} ^{\varphi\gamma}}$$

As a result, ([\[P_ij_phigamma\]](#P_ij_phigamma){reference-type="ref"
reference="P_ij_phigamma"}) and
([\[Q_ij_phigamma\]](#Q_ij_phigamma){reference-type="ref"
reference="Q_ij_phigamma"}) can be replaced with
([\[replaced_P_ij_phigamma\]](#replaced_P_ij_phigamma){reference-type="ref"
reference="replaced_P_ij_phigamma"}) and
([\[replaced_Q_ij_phigamma\]](#replaced_Q_ij_phigamma){reference-type="ref"
reference="replaced_Q_ij_phigamma"}):

::: center
$$\label{replaced_P_ij_phigamma}
\begin{split}
\textit{P}_{i_{inject}} ^{\varphi} + P _{i_{PV}} ^{\varphi} =  P _{i_{ld}} ^{\varphi} +  P _{i_{EV}} ^{\varphi} \\ +\displaystyle\sum_{\ell|(i,j)\in L}\displaystyle\sum_{\gamma|\gamma\in\phi}\hat{P_{ij}^{\varphi\gamma}}
\end{split}$$
:::

$$\label{replaced_Q_ij_phigamma}
\begin{split}
Q_{i_{inject}} ^{\varphi} + Q _{i_{PV}} ^{\varphi} =  Q _{i_{ld}} ^{\varphi} +  Q _{i_{EV}} ^{\varphi} \\ +\displaystyle\sum_{\ell|(i,j)\in L}\displaystyle\sum_{\gamma|\gamma\in\phi}\hat{Q_{ij}^{\varphi\gamma}}
\end{split}$$

## Capacity constraint

Capacity of distribution lines should guarantee the secure operation of
the system. So, it can be written as:

$$\label{line_capacity_constraint}
\begin{split}
\forall (i,j) \in \ell, \forall \varphi,\varphi \in \phi \hskip 25pt \\ S _{ij}^{\varphi\varphi}= \sqrt{P _{ij}^{\varphi\varphi2}+Q _{ij}^{\varphi\varphi2}} \leq S _{ij}^{max}
\end{split}$$

In perspective of optimization problem parameters and variables, the
equation
([\[line_capacity_constraint\]](#line_capacity_constraint){reference-type="ref"
reference="line_capacity_constraint"}) is nonlinear and nonconvex.
Therefore, linear approximation using piecewise linearization method
[@akbari2016linear] is applied to maintain the linear and convex form of
the problem and can be shown as:

::: center
$$\label{linearized_line_capacity_constraint}
\begin{split}
\forall h, h\in N, h\leq H, \forall(i,j) \in \ell, \forall\varphi,\varphi \in \phi \hskip 20pt \\
\left(\sin\left(\frac{360^{\circ}h}{H}\right)-\sin\left(\frac{360^{\circ}}{H}(h-1)\right)\right) P_{ij} ^{\varphi \varphi}-\\
\left(\cos\left(\frac{360^{\circ}h}{H}\right)-\cos\left(\frac{360^{\circ}}{H}(h-1)\right)\right) Q_{ij} ^{\varphi \varphi} \\ \leq S_{ij}^{max} \times \sin\left(\frac{360^{\circ}}{H}\right)
\end{split}$$
:::

## Voltage constraints: magnitude, imbalance factor

The hard margin constraint voltage magnitude constraint is implemented
as:

$$\label{Voltage_magnitude_constraint}
\forall i, \varphi, \hskip 0.3pc i \in N, \varphi \in \phi, \hskip 1pc V_{min} \leq V_{i}^{\varphi} \leq V_{max}$$

In
([\[Voltage_magnitude_constraint\]](#Voltage_magnitude_constraint){reference-type="ref"
reference="Voltage_magnitude_constraint"}) the $V_{min}$ and $V_{max}$
are the voltage magnitude limits determined by the standards. In order
to maintain power quality standards in unbalanced system the VUF
standard is taken into consideration [@smith2009ieee]. Equation
([\[VUF_Constraint\]](#VUF_Constraint){reference-type="ref"
reference="VUF_Constraint"}) demonstrates the definition of VUF.

$$\label{VUF_Constraint}
VUF_{i} = \frac {|V_{i}^{-}|} {|V_{i}^{+}|} \leq VUF_{max}$$

It should be mentioned that the hard margin implementation of highly
non-linear VUF constraint is impossible in the convex optimization
platform. Therefore the two options could be hard margin linear VUF
approximation and soft margin quadratic approximation in a weighted-sum
multiple objective optimization model. It is later discussed in
[4.1](#Reg){reference-type="ref" reference="Reg"} that the latter is a
more accurate approach, and therefore it is used as a VUF constraint
basis in the presented formulation. The quadratic approximation of VUF
can be shown as:

$$\label{VUF_apr}
\begin{split}
VUF_{i} \approx VUF_{i}^{apr} 
\end{split}$$ where: $$\label{VUF_apr_simplified}
\begin{split}
VUF_{i}^{apr} = \displaystyle\sum_{0\leq n\leq2}\displaystyle\sum_{0\leq m\leq<n}\displaystyle\sum_{\varphi,\gamma\in\phi}(\alpha_{i_{mn}}^{\varphi\gamma}(V_i^\varphi)^m(V_i^\gamma)^{n-m}\\ + \beta_{i_{mn}}^{\varphi\gamma}(V_i^\varphi)^m(\theta_i^\gamma)^{n-m} + \delta_{i_{mn}}^{\varphi\gamma}(\theta_i^\varphi)^m(\theta_i^\gamma)^{n-m})
\end{split}$$

## Objective function

Without loss of generality, the minimum operational cost of the system
is sought here as
([\[objective_function\]](#objective_function){reference-type="ref"
reference="objective_function"}).

$$\label{objective_function}
\begin{split}
OF \in R, \hskip 100pt \\ \hskip 0.5pt OF=\displaystyle\sum_{s\in S} (c_1^s + c_2^s P_{inject_s^{\varphi}}+ c_3^s (P_{inject_s^{\varphi}})^2)
\end{split}$$

The active power injection of PVs and reactive power support of EVCSs
are assumed to be costless. The objective functions can be readily
tailored for meshed and multiple input distribution networks connected
to MV systems with different cost terms. The objective function can also
imply either minimization of the cost or maximization of firm benefit in
the highly PV penetrated, and reverse power flow enabled systems. It is
quite straightforward to replace it with maximum social welfare, maximum
firm benefit, etc., or even proceed with multiple objectives, for the
purpose of this paper the multi objective objective function is
presented as
([\[objective_function_VUF\]](#objective_function_VUF){reference-type="ref"
reference="objective_function_VUF"}).

$$\label{objective_function_VUF}
\begin{split}
0\leq w',w_i \leq1
 , \; OF \in R,  \hskip 100pt \\ \hskip 0.5pt OF=w'\displaystyle\sum_{s\in S} (c_1^s + c_2^s P_{inject_s^{\varphi}}+ c_3^s (P_{inject_s^{\varphi}})^2)
\\+\displaystyle\sum_{i\in N} w_iVUF_{i}^{apr}
\end{split}$$

The weight coefficient $w_i$ is flexible to be customized for each bus
to enable prioritizing the power quality constrain in certain buses. In
other words, improve imbalance of a certain bus by only exploiting the
existing system flexibility in the operation, without performing local
modifications or installations. The weight coefficients used in the
current approach is further discussed in
[4.2](#Pareto){reference-type="ref" reference="Pareto"}.

## EVCS models

EVCSs are considered both single- and three-phase in distribution
systems. While they can flexibly provide reactive power based on system
optimization, their consumed active power is assumed to be constant and
adjusted based on the customer charging preference and the battery and
inverter capability in a certain period of time. Nevertheless, they can
provide some flexibility over consumed active power in each time
interval thanks to their schedulability. Because we are targeted to
perform the optimization in the near real time scope to handle random
phenomena, we prefer to ignore this capability at least in the scope of
this study. The formulation of a single-phase EVCS in phase $\kappa$ is
shown in
([\[single_phase_EVCSs_model1\]](#single_phase_EVCSs_model1){reference-type="ref"
reference="single_phase_EVCSs_model1"})-([\[single_phase_EVCSs_model3\]](#single_phase_EVCSs_model3){reference-type="ref"
reference="single_phase_EVCSs_model3"}). For simplification, EVCSs are
shortened to EVs in the optimization formulations.

$$\label{single_phase_EVCSs_model1}
\forall i, i \in N \hskip 1pc P_{i_{EV}}^{\kappa}=P_{i_{EV}}^{sch}$$

$$\label{single_phase_EVCSs_model2}
\forall i, i \in N \hskip 0.5pc \forall \varphi, \varphi \in \phi |\hskip 0.2pc \varphi \neq \kappa, \hskip 0.8pc P_{i}^{EV}= 0$$

$$\label{single_phase_EVCSs_model3}
\begin{split}
\forall i, i \in N \hskip 1pc -\sqrt{(S_{i_{EV}}^{inv})^2 - (P_{i_{EV}}^{\kappa})^2} \leq Q_{i_{EV}}^{\kappa}\\ \leq + \sqrt{(S_{i_{EV}}^{inv})^2 - (P_{i_{EV}}^{\kappa})^2}
\end{split}$$

The variable $Q_{i_{EV}} ^{\kappa}$ can be derived based on the result
of the optimization problem. Equations
([\[three_phase_EVCSs_model1\]](#three_phase_EVCSs_model1){reference-type="ref"
reference="three_phase_EVCSs_model1"})-([\[three_phase_EVCSs_model3\]](#three_phase_EVCSs_model3){reference-type="ref"
reference="three_phase_EVCSs_model3"}) show the three-phase EVCS model
and corresponding linearization. In the three-phase case,
([\[single_phase_EVCSs_model1\]](#single_phase_EVCSs_model1){reference-type="ref"
reference="single_phase_EVCSs_model1"}) and
([\[single_phase_EVCSs_model2\]](#single_phase_EVCSs_model2){reference-type="ref"
reference="single_phase_EVCSs_model2"}) are changed to
([\[three_phase_EVCSs_model1\]](#three_phase_EVCSs_model1){reference-type="ref"
reference="three_phase_EVCSs_model1"}) in which the cross-phase active
power transfer is also enabled.

$$\label{three_phase_EVCSs_model1}
\forall i \in N, \hskip 2pt \displaystyle\sum _{\varphi \in \phi} P_{i_{EV}}^{\varphi} = P_{i_{EV}}^{sch}$$

$$\label{three_phase_EVCSs_model2}
\forall i, i \in N, \forall \varphi, \varphi \in \phi, \hskip 0.7pc \sqrt{(P_{i_{EV}}^{\varphi})^2 +(Q_{i_{EV}}^{\varphi})^2} \leq S_{i_{EV}}^{inv}$$

$$\label{three_phase_EVCSs_model3}
\begin{split}
\forall h, h \in H, \hskip 1pt \forall i, i \in N, \hskip 1pt \forall \varphi, \varphi \in \phi \hskip 30pt \\ \left(\sin\left(\frac{360^\circ h}{H}\right)- \sin\left(\frac{360^\circ}{H}(h-1)\right)\right)P_{i_{EV}}^{\varphi} \\
-\left(\cos\left(\frac{360^\circ h}{H}\right)- \cos\left(\frac{360^\circ}{H}(h-1)\right)\right)Q_{i_{EV}}^{\varphi} \\ \leq S_{i_{EV}}^{inv} \times \sin\left(\frac{360^\circ}{H}\right)
\end{split}$$

Therefore, corresponding $P_{i_{EV}}^{\varphi}$(cross-phase active
power) can be derived based on the optimization results as well as the
$Q_{i_{EV}}^{\varphi}$. The noteworthy point is that even during the off
hours of EVCSs, the active power can be transferred between phases like
an active power line conditioner [@salmeron2004compensation]. This
enables the EVCSs to provide more active ancillary services if needed
and make them more economically reasonable.

## PVs model

As same as the EVCSs, PVs are installed as three-phase and single-phase
in distribution networks. While the three-phase PVs can contribute to
the balancing and voltage magnitude control, the single-phase
configurations may be harmful to the system power quality when used
uncontrolled. Therefore, PV management not only can help the
optimization problem to have enough flexibility to satisfy its
objective, but also it is necessary for maintaining the power quality
standards. The single-phase PV in phase $\kappa$ can be modeled as:

$$\label{PV_model_1}
\forall i, i \in N, \hskip 2pt 0 \leq P_{i_{PV}}^{\kappa} \leq P_{i_{PV}}^{sun}$$

$$\label{PV_model_2}
\forall i, i \in N, \hskip 3pt \forall \varphi, \varphi \in \phi | \varphi \neq \kappa, \hskip 3pt P_{i_{PV}}^{\varphi}=0$$

$$\label{PV_model_3}
\forall i, i \in N, \hskip 5pt \sqrt{\left(P_{i_{PV}}^{\kappa}\right)^2 +\left(Q_{i_{PV}}^{\kappa}\right)^2} \leq S_{i_{PV}}^{inv}$$

With the linear approximation,
([\[PV_model_3\]](#PV_model_3){reference-type="ref"
reference="PV_model_3"}) can be replaced by:

$$\label{linear_PV_model}
\begin{split}
\forall h, h \in H, \hskip 1pt \forall i, i \in N, \hskip 50pt \\ \left(\sin\left(\frac{360^\circ h}{H}\right)- \sin\left(\frac{360^\circ}{H}(h-1)\right)\right)P_{i_{PV}}^{\kappa} \\
-\left(\cos\left(\frac{360^\circ h}{H}\right)- \cos\left(\frac{360^\circ}{H}(h-1)\right)\right)Q_{i_{PV}}^{\kappa} \\ \leq S_{i_{PV}}^{inv} \times \sin\left(\frac{360^\circ}{H}\right)
\end{split}$$

The corresponding $P_{i_{PV}}^{\kappa}$ and $P_{i_{PV}}^{\kappa}$ are
derived as a result of the optimization problem. The three-phase PV
model and the approximation are presented in
([\[three-phase_PV_model_1\]](#three-phase_PV_model_1){reference-type="ref"
reference="three-phase_PV_model_1"}),([\[three_phase_PVs_model2\]](#three_phase_PVs_model2){reference-type="ref"
reference="three_phase_PVs_model2"}), and
([\[three_phase_PVs_model3\]](#three_phase_PVs_model3){reference-type="ref"
reference="three_phase_PVs_model3"}), respectively:

$$\label{three-phase_PV_model_1}
\forall i \in N, \hskip 3pt 
0 \leq \displaystyle\sum_{\varphi\in\phi} P_{i_{PV}}^{\varphi} \leq P_{i_{PV}}^{sun}$$

$$\label{three_phase_PVs_model2}
\forall i, i \in N, \forall \varphi, \varphi \in \phi, \hskip 0.7pc \sqrt{(P_{i_{PV}}^{\varphi})^2 +(Q_{i_{PV}}^{\varphi})^2} \leq S_{i_{PV}}^{inv}$$

$$\label{three_phase_PVs_model3}
\begin{split}
\forall h, h \in H, \hskip 1pt \forall i, i \in N, \hskip 1pt \forall \varphi, \varphi \in \phi \hskip 20pt\\ \left(\sin\left(\frac{360^\circ h}{H}\right)- \sin\left(\frac{360^\circ}{H}(h-1)\right)\right)P_{i_{PV}}^{\varphi} \\
-\left(\cos\left(\frac{360^\circ h}{H}\right)- \cos\left(\frac{360^\circ}{H}(h-1)\right)\right)Q_{i_{PV}}^{\varphi} \\ \leq S_{i_{PV}}^{inv} \times \sin\left(\frac{360^\circ}{H}\right)
\end{split}$$

Finally, the $P_{i_{PV}}^{\varphi}$ and $Q_{i_{PV}}^{\varphi}$ can be
derived as a result of the optimization problem. To sum up, the QP
framework will be the minimization of the objective function of
([\[objective_function\]](#objective_function){reference-type="ref"
reference="objective_function"}) subject to

# Computational Implementation

## Input Structure and Test Cases

The input Data structure is built and developed based on the MATPOWER
structure [@zimmerman2010matpower]. The Matpower test case structure is
modified from single line balanced to three phase unbalanced in order to
be able to add the three-phase unbalanced test cases to the case
library. For the purpose of this paper, two unbalanced standard systems
are added to Matpower library; IEEE 33 Bus [@baran1989network] and the
192 LV buses of the IEEE 342-bus test system [@schneider2014ieee]. The
two systems are chosen in such away that cover different voltage levels,
bus numbers, topology type (meshed or radial) and number of slack buses.
Assuming the symmetrical configuration of its lines and cables, the IEEE
33-bus system is modified to be balanced three-phase system and then the
loads are forced to be unbalanced by load intensity factor which will be
defined later in the paper. However, the 192 LV buses of the IEEE
342-bus test system is inherently unbalanced and heavily meshed and
connected to the MV system from different nodes in order to maintain
reliability and satisfy the high load density. For the purpose of this
research, single-phase and three phase PV and EVCs with different

## Method Clustering

The proposed method is clustered into Five sub-methods presented in
table [2](#table1){reference-type="ref" reference="table1"} to form an
ablation study. The *Fixed* method is regular OPF solver in Matpower
extended to three phase systems. Consequently, three-phase EVs and PVs
are considered as three single-phase models. The *OPF* method is the
linearized form of the *Fixed* method solved in CVX. The *OPF VUF*
method is the *OPF* method that consideres the VUF constraint.
Similarly, the *Crossphase* method is the *OPF* with enabling the
crossphase capability of PVs and EVs. Finally the *CrossPhase VUF*
method integrates all the contributions of this paper in one method.
Both Matpower and CVX solvers are run in the the MATLAB 2022a, Intel
Core i5 8250U (1.6-1.8 GHz) CPU, and 8 GB DDR3-1333 (667 MHz) memory
Environment.

## Operation Scenarios and time intervals {#scenario_section}

In order to test the individual and combined contribution of each
inverter type, three scenarios are considered as *Base(NC)*,
*PV-noon(NC)*, *Ev-night(NC)*, and *PV-EV-Afternoon*. In addition,
unlike the *Fixed*, *OPF* and *OPF-VUF* methods, *Crossphase* and
*Crossphase OPF* methods have the ability to exploit the active power
capacity of the inverters in their non operation hours. In other words,
non operation hours for PVs is night, which is day in case of EVs
Accordingly, three more scenarios are added as *Base(C)*, *PV-noon(C)*,
*Ev-night(C)*, to elevate the contribution of each inverter type in non
operational hours. So, capacity of the inverters can be used in non
operational hours by proposed method.

All of the scenarios consists of eight time intervals each having a
different load imbalance level as shown in Fig.
[2](#Load Imbalance){reference-type="ref" reference="Load Imbalance"}.
The load imbalance (Active and Reactive) is getting worse linearly in
each interval while maintaining a constant total load consumption in
order to obtain standardized load flow results.

# Parameter Tuning {#PT}

## VUF Quadratic Regression {#Reg}

In ([\[VUF_apr_simplified\]](#VUF_apr_simplified){reference-type="ref"
reference="VUF_apr_simplified"}) the $\alpha_{i_{mn}}^{\varphi\gamma}$
$\beta_{i_{mn}}^{\varphi\gamma}$ $\delta_{i_{mn}}^{\varphi\gamma}$, can
be approximated by a data-driven regression method trained on a VUF
results of a set of large data points of voltage angle and magnitude in
the operational range. For the purpose of this study the data points are
created by sweeping voltage magnitude from $V_{min}=.09$ to
$V_{max}=1.1$ with 0.1 increment and angles are swept between
$-5^{\circ}$ to $5^{\circ}$ with $1^{\circ}$ increments. The leveraged
data-driven method is the least square multi-variable quadratic
regression. Figure []{#VUF_reg label="VUF_reg"} represents the scatter
plot of both linear and quadratic regressions. As it can be shown in the
figure the although the quadratic regression has a large approximation
error due to the high non-linearity of VUF function, it is relatively
better that the linear results. Therefore that weighted-sum multiple
objective approach is more accurate than hard margin linear VUF
implementation. The resultant parameters are embedded to the *OPF VUF*
and *Crossphase VUF* methods.

VUF](pdf/VUF_reg.pdf){#VUF_reg width="8cm"}

## Pareto Front Trade-Off {#Pareto}

In order to enabling a quantified trade-off between cost and sum of VUFs
the Pareto method is used. For having a 2D Pareto Front, it is assumed
that all buses have the same weight and $w'=(1-w)$. The Pareto front
with 0.1 increments for the *Crossphase VUF* method is illustrated in
figure [4](#prt){reference-type="ref" reference="prt"} for the *PVEV
afternoon* scenario. it can be seen that for all time intervals there is
a significant reduction in sum of VUFs when increasing $w$ from 0 to
0.1. However, further increase of $w$ seems to not have significant
decrease in the VUF sum value while it increases the cost drastically.
Therefore, the $w=0.1$ is chosen to use in the proposed weighted sum
method.

# Results and Discussion

This section compares the effectiveness of the presented sub-methods and
scenarios in four aspects; 1) total cost, 2) voltage imbalance, 3) total
loss, and 4) line capacity utilization. For each of the mentioned
aspects, first, the [2](#table1){reference-type="ref"
reference="table1"} sub-methods are compared in the most complete
scenario, *PVEV afternoon*. Then the
[3.3](#scenario_section){reference-type="ref"
reference="scenario_section"} scenarios are compared for the
state-of-the-art method, *CrossPhase VUF*.

## Total cost of the studied systems

Total cost of the systems for the sub-methods of Table.
[2](#table1){reference-type="ref" reference="table1"} is evaluated for
the fifth time interval in Table.[3](#Table9){reference-type="ref"
reference="Table9"}. Assessing the table proves that using a cross-phase
enabled sub-method reduces the total cost of the systems in both test
systems. As it is visible, utilizing the other sub-methods is not so
profitable compared to the . This cost reduction is achieved by
exploiting the capacity of PV and EV inverters during operational and
non-operational hours in *Crossphase* and *Crossphase VUF* method. Fig.
[5](#Cross){reference-type="ref" reference="Cross"} shows a comparison
between the apparent, active, and reactive power reference of the
three-phase EV charger installed on bus number 88 of the IEEE 192 bus
system for both *Crossphase* and *OPF* methods during operational and
non-operational hours. As it can be shown on the figure, the inverter
capacity utilization in operational mode is 5% more when crossphase is
enabled. Moreover, in non-operational hours, crossphase enables the
inverter to circulate the active power by consuming power from phase c,
and transferring it to phase b to compensate the induced load imbalance
shown in figure [2](#Load Imbalance){reference-type="ref"
reference="Load Imbalance"}. Also, as shown in Tables.
[\[Table11\]](#Table11){reference-type="ref" reference="Table11"}, the
total cost of the *Crossphase VUF* is lesser in the scenarios that
enables the inverters to contribute in non-operational hours than the
scenarios that turn the inverters off during non-operation. This
resultant crossphase flexibility, leads to a better optimal solution in
terms of cost. It should be mentioned that due to the meshed topology of
IEEE 192 bus, enabling crossphase is not guaranteed as in the IEEE 33
bus radial system. This behaviour is related to possible current
imbalance propagation to several main lines in meshed grids which is
further discussed in [5.3](#secloss){reference-type="ref"
reference="secloss"}. Another result that can be obtained from the
tables. [\[Table11\]](#Table11){reference-type="ref"
reference="Table11"} is that although both systems have more PVs in
terms of capacity and numbers installed, EVs show a better
non-operational crossphase contribution for cost reduction.

Sub-methods that contain a VUF constraint, experience a higher total
cost because of the additional term in their objective functions. It can
be seen that in both systems intensifying the load imbalance will
increase system cost in VUF constrained sub-methods. The cost difference
between the VUF-constrained and non constrained sub-methods, is the
price that should be paid for compensation of the VUF.

## Voltage Imbalance

Figure [6](#VUF33m){reference-type="ref" reference="VUF33m"} and
[7](#VUF192m){reference-type="ref" reference="VUF192m"} compares the
results of the VUF for each bus in all time intervals with the mentioed
sub-methods of table. [2](#table1){reference-type="ref"
reference="table1"}. The results shows the superiority of *crossphase
VUF* in reducing the VUF in comparison with others. Also, the
*crossphase* show reduction in VUF howeve, the effect of VUF constraint
is more than crossphase individully. The *OPF* and *Fixed* method that
are only different in their lineararity of constraints and solver show a
very severe VUF especially in intense time intervals.

The results for the Scenarios other than *PVEV afternoon* are summarized
in table. [5](#VUFstandar){reference-type="ref" reference="VUFstandar"}.
In this table only the results for the most extreme condition (time
interval 8) are shown. According to the table, however the standard
could not be maintained in this worst case scenario, the crossphase
contribution of EVs and PVs were significantly effective in reducing the
nonstandard conditioned buses. Also results reveal that unlike the cost,
in terms of VUF reduction, crossphase contribution of PVs in both *Base
(C)* and *EV Night (C)* are more effective than crossphase contribution
of EVs such that in IEEE 33 bus system they were able to reach a
standard solution. The results also reveals that the crossphase
capability is more effective in radial 33 bus than heavily meshed 192
bus system.

## Total power loss of the test systems {#secloss}

Total power loss of the test systems for different sub-methods are
pointed out in Tables. [6](#Table5){reference-type="ref"
reference="Table5"} and [7](#Table6){reference-type="ref"
reference="Table6"}. Analyzing Table.[6](#Table5){reference-type="ref"
reference="Table5"} clears that by increasing load imbalance intensity,
total power loss of the IEEE 33-Bus system experiences an upward trend.
Due to the constant three-phase load power in all intervals, it can be
concluded that the the increase in loss is solely a result of increase
in the line imbalance. Before discussing the relation between line
imbalance and crossphase, it needs to be mentioned that the crossphase
opeartion for the cost and VUF minimization can have two forms: 1)
allocating power of the inverter in order to meet the unbalanced load
demand. 2) transferring flowing power probably generated from a
collection of single-phase PVs in one phase to another. The first form
will locally compensate the line imbalance of the lower side and can
have a balancing effect on the upper main line in radial systems. The
latter however will exploit the line capacity to transfer a generated
single phase power to the upper side loads or loads in the other phases
and therefore my not guarantee a balanced upper main line balance. By
taking the above mentioned into consideration, it can be seen that on
table. [6](#Table5){reference-type="ref" reference="Table5"} when the
loads are nearly balanced (intervals 1-3) *crossphase VUF* compromises
the the line imbalance and the loss to reach a better VUF and cost,
however in the highly unbalanced situations, the *crossphase VUF*
minimizes the VUF and cost without any need to compromise the loss.
Therefore in these cases both current and voltage imbalance are
minimized alongside with the cost. Analysing the results of table.
[7](#Table6){reference-type="ref" reference="Table6"} with the same
manner reveals that in the presented heavily meshed grid, the loss in
*crossphase VUF* is more than *crossphase* in all time intervals which
means that the line imbalance most be compromised to reach a better VUF.
This behaviour is like the behaviour of the radial grid between (1-3)
intervals. Therefore it can be concluded that the voltage and current
imbalance are not always inlined.

The scenario based results are presented in tables
[8](#Table7){reference-type="ref" reference="Table7"} and
[9](#Table8){reference-type="ref" reference="Table8"}. According to 33
Bus system results, non-operational contribution of EVs and PVs both
worked in favor of the system loss reduction in all intervals which
illustrates the superiority of cross phasing in radial topology in terms
of loss. In analysing different conclusions can be made. First,
comparing the results of *Base (NC)* and *(C)* for interval 1 where
there is no single-phase generation reveals that attempt to reduce VUF
and cost will propagate line imbalance due to meshed topology. This
result shows that the claim made for the first form of cross-phasing is
not valid in meshed networks. Second, in comparing results of *EV Night
(NC)* and *(C)*, where the cross phasing is dine by PVs and a lot of
single-phase generation exists, loss reduction will not occur before
interval 7 which supports the claim made in the previous paragraph about
the second form of cross-phasing. On the other hand, *PV noon (NC)* and
*(C)* shows that only EV cross-phasing in full presence of PVs was able
to reduce the loss in all time intervals successfully.

# Conclusion

In this paper an exact three-phase optimal power flow that includes both
voltage angle and magnitude (AC load load flow) that also works in
meshed networks is introduced to be able to optimally manage the per
phase active and reactive power references of single and three phase PVs
and EVs. The consideration of voltage angle and magnitude enabled the
optimal power flow to include the VUF as an operational
constraint/objective. In addition, in order to guarantee a good
computational performance, all the optimal power flow and constraints
are linearized and VUF constrained is approximated with a second degree
multi-variable polynomial by regression over an inclusive data set in
the operational range of voltage magnitudes and angles. This
considerations led to a quadratic formulation of three-phase optimal
power flow that can be solved by fast convex solvers. In addition, the
cross-phase capability of three-phase EVs and PVs are implemented into
formulations to fully exploit the inverter capacity to minimize cost and
fix the VUF. This crossphase capability can also be profitable in
non-operational modes of PVs and EVs. Later on, in order to better
integrate VUF and cost minimization, a Pareto front trade-off has been
made. In order to show the the effect of both including VUF constraint
and cross-phase capability in operational and non-operational modes,
multiple sub-methods and scenario are tested in terms of total cost,
total loss, and VUF reduction in IEEE 33 bus radial and IEEE 192 heavily
meshed systems.

The method comparison results revealed that using a cross-phase enabled
sub-methods reduces the total cost of the systems in both test systems
and the Sub-methods. This reduction is the cost that an inverter owner
saves for DSO by enabling the cross-phase capability. Also sub-methods
containing a VUF constraint, experience a higher total cost because of
the additional term in their objective functions while showing a
superiority reducing the VUF. Therefore, the cost difference between the
VUF-constrained and non constrained sub-methods, is the price that
should be paid for compensation of the VUF. In terms of loss, by
increasing load imbalance intensity, total power loss of the systems
which is closely related to line imbalance due to normalized
implementation of load imbalance experienced an upward trend with
increase in load imbalance. When the loads were nearly balanced
*crossphase VUF* compromised the the line imbalance to obtain a better
VUF and cost, however in the highly unbalanced situations, the
*crossphase VUF* minimized the VUF and cost without any need to
compromise the line imbalance. In terms of scenario comparison, results
for multiple scenarios showed that enabling non-operational cross-phase
leads to a better optimal solution in terms of cost and is significantly
effective in reducing the VUF.

Finally, as a device based comparison, EVs show a better non-operational
cross-phase contribution for cost reduction. however, in terms of VUF
reduction, it is vise versa.
